# SMART-PARKING-SYSTEM-USING-IoT-SENSORS-ML

As the population grows exponentially, vehicular traffic and parking have become significant 
challenges, particularly in public spaces with high visitor volumes. A considerable amount of time 
is wasted searching for vacant parking spots, and the current parking systems often rely heavily on 
manual labor. Additionally, there is no efficient way to ascertain the availability of parking spaces 
in real time. 
This project proposes a Smart Parking System utilizing IoT sensors and machine learning to address 
these issues effectively. The system employs IoT sensors such as cameras, and ultrasonic sensors to 
detect and classify vehicles entering the parking space. Machine learning algorithms are integrated 
to distinguish between cars and bikes. Based on the classification, the system directs vehicles to their 
designated parking areas cars are guided to the left parking section, while bikes are directed to the 
right parking section. This ensures seamless and efficient parking management. 
Real-time availability of parking slots is communicated through LED display. The system reducing 
human intervention and improving efficiency. By automating the process, this Smart Parking 
System not only saves time but also enhances user convenience and reduces traffic congestion in 
busy areas.
